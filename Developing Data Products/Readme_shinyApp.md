shinyApp Readme file
========================================================

This respository contains the code for my 'shinyApp' for the course project in Coursera's Developing Data Products. The working version of the application can be found here: [shinyApp][1].

# Description
This is designed to predict an iris species based on parameters selected by the user. There are four sliders that allow the user to select Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width. Once the desired parameters are selected the user can then press the "Update" button. The program will use the selected paramters to predict the most likely species that matches these attributes. The application also provides an image for reference.
